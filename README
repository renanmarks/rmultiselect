RMultiSelect
============

After searching the hole internets for a jQuery plugin that have the classic "go to left" / "go to right" UI, I've decided to create my own plugin that resembles that simple functionality that users love. Without any sofisticated configuration and functionality.

A simple plugin that "Just-works"!

Use
---

To use this plugin, simple include the JS in your HTML page and call it:
  
  $(function () {
    $('select[multiple="multiple"]').RMultiSelect();
  });

Hope you enjoy it!
